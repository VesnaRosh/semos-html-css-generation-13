            <h2>ROGUE - Crossfit connection</h2>
            <p>Rogue has been associated with CrossFit from its beginning. Rogue is one of the primary suppliers for equipment for CrossFit boxes around the world.It started supplying equipment for the CrossFit Games in 2009, before becoming the sole provider to the Games and regional events in 2010. Fifteen semi-trucks of equipment were needed to supply the 2013 CrossFit Games at the StubHub Center in Carson, California, up from nine trucks used to supply the 2011 CrossFit Games. Rogue often creates new or unusual equipment specially for the Games. It organizes Rogue Invitational, one of the most significant events for CrossFit athletes. The company briefly cut off its ties with CrossFit after controversial statements made by CrossFit founder Greg Glassman in 2020, but has resumed their association after Glassman resigned.</p>
